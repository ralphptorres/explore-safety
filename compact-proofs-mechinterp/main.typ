= Introduction

== The problem of understanding a model

=== Why do we care about about understanding a model?

When we use or train a model, many things can go wrong. For example, during
training the model can learn undesired behaviour, which is not obvious to us
(deceptive alignment). Or it might have failure modes that are not salient to us
(adversarial examples). On the other hand, we could steer a model towards a
desired behaviour, if we understood how it works.

All of these issues could be resolved, if the models were transparent to us
(though this is not the only approach). So an important question to raise here
is: What do we mean when we talk of "a mechanistic understanding" of a model?
When is a model transparent to us?

This is a difficult question! Let's say you study a model and reverse engineered
parts of it, like a circuit. How can you be sure that the circuit you found
actually does the thing you are claiming it is? Let's look at the specific
example of autoencoders. This is a quote from

  Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning

#quote[
  Usually in machine learning we can quite easily tell if a method is working by
  looking at an easily-measured quantity like the test loss. We spent quite some
  time searching for an equivalent metric to guide our efforts here, and
  unfortunately have yet to find anything satisfactory.

  We began by looking for an information-based metric, so that we could say in
  some sense that the best factorization is the one that minimizes the total
  information of the autoencoder and the data. Unfortunately, this total
  information did not generally correlate with subjective feature
  interpretability or activation sparsity.[...]

  Thus we ended up using a combination of several additional metrics to guide
  our investigations[...]

  Interpreting or measuring some of these signals can be difficult, though. For
  instance, at various points we thought we saw features which at first didnâ€™t
  make any sense, but with deeper inspection we could understand.

  We think it would be very helpful if we could identify better metrics for
  dictionary learning solutions from sparse autoencoders trained on
  transformers.

=== Quantative methods for interpretability

Having quantative methods would not only make mechanistic interpretability
research more rigorous. If we want to scale up methods to huge models, we will
need to automate parts of the process and we won't be able to have a human in
the loop at every crucial point. A lack of quantative benchmarks makes this task
seem almost impossible. To spoiler the punchline: Compact proofs provide such a
quantative benchmark, although they currently are infeasible for larger models.

Before getting into the details, let's nail down two things that we want to
quantify. The following two points are taken from the #link(

  + Correspondence (or faithfulness): How well our explanation reflects the
    model's internals.
  + Compression: Explanations compress the particular behavior of interest. Not
    just so that it fits in our heads, but also so that it generalizes well and
    is feasible to find and check.
]

Specifically, the second points implies that the explanation, say the circuit
that we discovered, should be more *compact* and therefore more understandable
for us humans: The weights of a model are a perfectly faithful explanation of
its behaviour, but this explanation is not helpful for us.

#image("fig/trade_off.png")


An important insight that we will make is that our explanations are not as good
as we might think. Specifically, *noise* in the model's weights seem negligible.
But worst case bound imply that it could still be an important contribuiting
factor. In fact, it might be that something that we deem as noise, is important
for the model's computation, but we simply don't understand it. This issue with
the noise is another point that a quantative evaluation should be able to
address.

== What are compact proofs?

Compact proofs are an attempt at formalizing the above diagram.

First of all, what do we mean by proof i.e. what are we trying to prove? Say we
are training a model with weights $theta$ on some task. The kinda of statements
that we want to prove are of the form
$
  EE [f_theta (x)] >= b
$
where $f_theta$ is a quantity that we are interested in bounding from below or
above (depending on the quantity), such as loss or accuracy.

The compactness of a proof is determined by its length. A good proxy for the
length is the FLOPS required to run the proof, see the #link(
  "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11779",
)[paper] for more details. (Maybe I will write more on this)

So once we have a proof, we can measure its correspondence by looking at the
bound and measure its compactness by measuring its length. We get a similar
picture to the one drawn above:

#image("fig/compact_proofs.png")

We will see many examples of proofs and compare their performance below. The
ideal goal here would be to have a pipeline that takes in a vague interpretation
of the model, turn that into a rigorous proof, and evaluate the interpretation
based on the correspondence and compactness of the proof.

As we will see below this turns out to be rather difficult, even in toy models.
The takeaway here is that quantification seems to be a hard problem and the
compact proof approach is an example of this.

= Max-of-2 example

Having worked through the high level picture, let us now focus on concrete
examples of compact proofs and explain what it means. Let's say we have a model:

#image("fig/model-2.png")

refer: `main.py > class MLP()`

In our first example, we will train the model to predict the max of the two
tokens, where the tokens range from $0$ to $d_"vocab"$. We will be interested in
estimating the global loss of this model, that is we want to estimate
$
  EE [f(t_1, t_2)]
  = 1 / d_"vocab"^2 dot sum_(t_1, t_2 in {0, ..., d_"vocab" - 1 }) f(t_1, t_2).
$

The general proof strategy consists of two steps:
+ P1: Prove a statement that given a model with its weights $theta$, there is a
  quantity $C(theta)$ such that $EE [h(x, M(x))] <= C(theta)$.
+ P2: Compute the quantity $C(theta)$.

We will come back to this after we did some proofs and also discuss what it
means to have a *compact* proof.

We train our model on $~10%$ of the whole data set. (This is not correct,
dataset is random each batch)

refer: `main.py > params = Parameters() ...`

Note that this is our *training set* loss.

]
```

== Brute force proof

Let's start proving things now! One thing we can do is a brute force proof.
Remember that our proofs will consist of two steps. The first step (P1) is as
follows

Theorem(Brute force proof): The expected loss of a model $M$ with weights
$theta$ is bounded above by $EE [f(t_1, t_2)]$.

Proof: By definition the bound is actually an equality.


That was an easy proof, but the ones we will encounter from now on will be more
difficult and feel less tautological! Now we come to the second part of the
proof (P2), which in this case means computing this quantity.

refer: `main.py > def brute_force()`

*A word on the "formal" in "formal proofs"*

Strictly speaking we would want to formalize our proofs, meaning that we would
rewrite them in a form that can be verified by a formal proof assistant such as
Lean or Coq. For a more serious use case this would be indeed necessary, but for
now I will leave it open to the you, the reader, to formalize the proof that you
would want to be verified. Generally speaking, be aware though that Lean and Coq
also have bugs!

== Symmetry proof

Our brute force proof gave the optimal bound, but at the cost of having to
compute all the inputs. Can we do better? Yes!

We start with the first part P1 of our proof. It will be based on the following
observation

Lemma: Let $f_theta (t_1, t_2)$ denote the neural network as depicted above.
Then
$
  f_theta (t_1,t_2) = f_theta (t_2,t_1).
$

Try to prove that statement!

*Proof*

This is a consequence of the following equalities
$
  f_theta (t_1, t_2)
  = g_theta (t_1 dot E + t_2 dot E)
  = g_theta (t_2 dot E + t_1 dot E)
  = f_theta (t_1, t_2).
$

Now you can use that statement to prove the following statement.

Theorem: The expected loss of a model $M$ with weights $theta$ is bounded by
(and in fact equal to)
$
  1 / d_"vocab"^2 dot [
    sum_(t_1 < t_2) 2 dot f_theta (t_1, t_2) + sum_(t_1) f_theta (t_1, t_1)
  ].
$

*Proof*

This is a consequence of the following equality
$
  sum_(t_1, t_2) f_theta (t_1, t_2)
  &= sum_(t_1 < t_2) f_theta (t_1, t_2)
  + sum_(t_1) f_theta (t_1, t_1)
  + sum_(t_1 > t_2) f_theta (t_1, t_2) \
  &= sum_(t_1 < t_2) f_theta (t_1, t_2)
  + sum_(t_1) f_theta (t_1, t_1)
  + sum_(t_2 < t_1) f_theta (t_2, t_1) \
  &= sum_(t_1 < t_2) 2 dot f_theta (t_1, t_2) + sum_(t_1) f_theta (t_1, t_1).
$

Now we can come to the second part P2 of our proof -- actually computing the
quantity.

refer: `main.py > def symmetry_proof_loss()`

== Convexity proof

So far our proofs didn't involve any proper bounds. We will now start using more
coarse bounds, but this will lead to a great increase in compression. The
central notion for this section is *convexity*.

Definition:
- A function $f : RR^n -> RR$ is convex, if $forall x,y in RR^n$ and
  $t in [0,1]$, we have an inequality
  $
    f(t x + (1 - t) y) <= t f(x) + (1 - t) f(y).
  $
- A function $f : RR^n -> RR^m$ is convex, if all the projections
  $f_1, ..., f_m : RR^n -> RR^m -->^(p r_i) RR$ are convex.

=== 1. Proving that $L compose g_theta (v)$ is convex:

First we prove this general statement:

Lemma: Let $f_1 : RR^n -> RR^m$ and $f_2 : RR^m -> RR^k$ be a linear and a
convex function respectively, then $f_2 compose f_1 : RR^n -> RR^k$ is convex as
well.

*Proof*

This follows from the following inequalities
$
  f_2 (f_1 (t dot x + (1-t) dot y))
  = f_2 (t dot f_1 (x) + (1-t) dot f_1 (y))
  <= t dot f_2 (f_1 (x)) + (1-t) dot f_2(f_1 (y))
$
where the first equality follows from linearity of $f_1$ and the second one from
convexity of $f_2$.

Now we will combine the above statement with the following lemma.

Lemma: $g_theta (v)$ is linear and $L(-,x)$ is convex.

*Proof*

- $g_theta (v)$ is a composition of linear functions, therefore also linear.

- There are several ways to prove that $L$ is convex. One could verify that the
  Hessian of $L$ is positive semi-definite or directly apply the HÃ¶lderlin
  inequality. Let's use the latter approach. Our goal is to show that for
  $x in RR^m$ we have the following function is convex
  $
    - log(e^(x_i) / (sum^m_(j=1) e^(x_j)))
  $
  where we fixed an $i in {1, ..., m}$ (corresponding to the correct label). We
  can rewrite the function as
  $
    - x_i + log(sum^m_(j=1) e^(x_j))
  $
  and it suffices to show that $log(sum^m_(j=1) e^(x_j))$ is convex. This
  follows from the HÃ¶lderlin inequality
  $
    sum e^(t dot x_i) e^((1-t) dot y_i)
    <= (sum e^(x_i))^t dot (sum e^(y_i))^(1-t).
  $


=== 2. Proving a bound for $f_theta (t_1, t_2)$

Theorem: The expected loss of a model $M$ with weights $theta$ is bounded above
by
$
  1 / d_"vocab"^2 dot [
    sum_(t_1) L(g_theta (t_1, t_1), t_1)
    + sum_(t_1 < t_2) L(g_theta (t_1, t_1), t_2) + L(g_theta (t_2, t_2), t_2)
  ].
$

Note that we can rewrite the first and last term as $f_theta (t_1, t_1)$ and
$f_theta(t_2, t_2)$ respectively, but we can't rewrite the middle term in terms
of $f_theta$ (Why?).

*Proof*

From the symmetric proof section we have seen that expected loss is equal to
$
  1 / d_"vocab"^2 dot [ sum_(t_1) f_theta (t_1, t_1) + sum_(t_1 < t_2) 2 dot f_theta (t_1, t_2) ].
$

From the previous lemma we have seen, given $t_2 > t_1$, that
$
  f_theta (t_1, t_2)
  = L(g_theta (t_1 dot E + t_2 dot E), t_2)
  <= 1 / 2 dot L(g_theta (2 dot t_1 dot E), t_2)
  + 1 / 2 dot L(g_theta (2 dot t_2 dot E), t_2)
$.

Combining the previous two statements yield the desired statement.

Now we come to the part P2 of our proof -- computing the above quantity.

== Summary

refer: `main.py > x = [performance[][] ...]`

#image("fig/proofs-loss.svg", width: 8em)

Let's break down what we see. On the $x$-axis we have the time it took to run
the proofs. This is a proxy for the compactness of the proof. Another related
notion would be to track the FLOPS needed to run the proof. We see that the
symmetric proof takes about half of the time compared to the brute force one.
This makes sense:

There is a total of $d^2$ inputs that the brute force proof needs. On the other
hand the symmetric proof needs only $(d(d+1)) / 2$ inputs. But note that our
architecture was very simple -- we can't expect such an easy improvement in
general. Note also that asymptotically both proofs scale *quadratic* in $d$.

On the other hand the convex proof scales only *linearly* in $d$. This is great,
but it comes at a great cost: Our bound is very bad and we find ourselves on the
other end of trade off, close to a vacuous proof. In fact, there is a straight
forward explanation why our bound will always be comparatively coarse. Can you
figure out why?

*The reason...*

...that we should expect a very coarse bound in the expression
$
  [ sum_(t_1) L(g_theta (t_1, t_1), t_1)
    + sum_(t_1 < t_2) L(g_theta (t_1, t_1), t_2)
    + L(g_theta(t_2, t_2), t_2)
  ].
$
is the middle term $L(g_theta (t_1, t_1), t_2)$. This term computes the
cross-entropy loss *not* between $ell_[t_1, t_1]$ and $t_1 = max([t_1, t_1])$,
but between $ell_[t_1, t_1]}$ and $t_2$. Thus even if our model would perform
optimally, this term would remain high.


This concludes the first example! In the next section, we will explore a
slightly different set up, where our convex proof will yield useful results.
After that we are ready to dig into the proofs of the paper and replicate some
of them. These will turn out to be more difficult, but will also make use of
more serious mechanistic machinery.
